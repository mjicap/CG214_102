Guys can feel that way, too." <br/><br/>In 2016, he became the ambassador for Chanel in South Korea.<br/> G-Dragon's fashion has been described as "quirky and experimental" by Rushali Pawar of the International Business Times while Taylor Glasby from the British Magazine Dazed and Confused characterized GD's style as "fluid and far-reaching," calling him a "natural style chameleon." <br/> Monica Kim from Vogue Magazine admired his "uncanny knack for larger-than-life style that remains wearably cool."<br/><br/>He was highlighted as one of the "50 Reasons Why Seoul is the Best City" by CNN in 2011, while in 2013, he was the highest ranking artist in the "Most Influential Entities of K-Pop" list by news agency Ilgan Sports.<br/><br/> G-Dragon was included in the 2015's and 2016's Business of Fashion's 500 Global Fashion Leaders lists, making him 1 of 5 Koreans on the list, and the only K-Pop act to have made the cut. <br/> He was also the only Korean in Hypebeast's 100 Innovators list. <br/> In 2016, G-Dragon was chosen as one of the top 10 most influential celebrities in China by Chinese media outlet Sina, he became the first international artist to be placed within the top 10 of Sina's Most Influential Stars rankings</p>
